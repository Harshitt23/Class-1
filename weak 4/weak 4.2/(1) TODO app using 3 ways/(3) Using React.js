/*    React is Better Than Direct DOM Manipulatiom. ------------ 
            React is not replacing JavaScript.
            React is replacing YOU manually fighting with the DOM.

        So doing DOm manipulation is very hard,
        whenever we r creating a dynamic website , we will use react instead.

❌ DOM:
Slow
Manual updates
Hard to manage
No components
UI breaks easily
Not scalable


✅ React:
Fast Virtual DOM)
Auto updates
Components
Reusable UI
Scalable for big apps
Cleaner code
Better developer experience


React = DOM + Power ⚡
DOM = Raw phone
React = Smartphone with apps, features, automation.*/
